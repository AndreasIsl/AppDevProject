# AppDevProject
Developed by Moritz Kupper, Sofija Sternad and Andreas Islitzer

Project idea: A  simple calender app which enhances the chore of using a normal calender through the use of diverse features, multi language support and a well designed ui.

Distribution of work: One feature per member??

List of features that could be added: 
+ Scanning dates with the camera
+ A nice animated ui
+ Voice recognition
+ Shared calender
+ Shared appointments
+ etc
